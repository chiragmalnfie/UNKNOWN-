        <p>AI is influencing every industrial department and humans virtually. It's the driver of leading emerging technologies, including robotics, IoT, and big data, and it would be the technological innovator in the predictable future.

            AI ingeniously mimics human behavior and standard reaction patterns to compete with them in almost every industry field. AI helps in programming machine technologies to do a variety of everyday tasks with high perfection and is already ubiquitous in digital lives, from smart devices to chatbots. Thanks to the computers that can store enough data related to human activities, purchases, and movements to build potentially strong AI. After all, researchers use this information to train machines for predicting, learning, and forecasting purposes.
            
            How will computers be used in the future? well... It is predicted that humans will be in a sleepwalking era where trillions of computers and machines will think like humans in AI's advanced future. A professor from the University of New South Wales, Walsh, wrote series of technology predictions for 2050 about AI in his book “Artificial Intelligence from <b>the Logic Piano to Killer Robot."</b></p>

        <p><b>Transportation future till 2050</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="brief2">
        <p>Transportation technology is progressing at a much slower pace than some of the other sciences such as information technology, biotech, and nanotechnology. As an example, the world’s human speed record was set in 1969, a full 37 years ago, when Thomas Stafford, John Young, and Gene Cernan flew in Apollo 10 at 24,790 mph. While there is much talk about flying at a speed that approaches the speed of light, very little effort is actually being expended in this area.

            However, transportation technology is about to move ahead more rapidly in the coming years with the advent of two radically new technologies – frictionless vehicles and binary power.
            
            Throughout history we have learned that the two principle driving forces of humanity are freedom and control. While current automotive technology gives us the freedom to drive as fast or slow as our vehicle will take us, and control over our timing and direction, we are still restricted to driving on the ground and we have a hornet’s nest of laws to contend with regarding speed, flow, and operation.
            
            Understanding the “freedom and control” drivers is key to understanding the future of transportation. Any new forms of transportation that do not measurably improve our sense of freedom or give us added control of our lives will likely fail in the marketplace.</p>

        <p><b>The era of Quantum Computing till 2050</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="brief3">
        <p>We give panelists free rein to think long-term and remove the 3 main roadblocks facing their research today, across various qubit platforms. Instead, we will focus on answering the following questions: What is the next set of big challenges for the quantum research community, and how should this affect the work being done today? What will the ideal future quantum computer look like? What hardware will it contain, and which problems will become the new roadblocks? What kind of architecture will be expected, and what would the role of quantum control be at that point?</p>
